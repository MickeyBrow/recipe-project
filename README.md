## Reflection

This project is a side project with the intent of learning a new technology. This was an opportunity to strengthen my full stack skills will also learning about mobile app development. 

The idea behind this project was to only make an app that allowed the user to take a picture of the fridge and get recipes back. However, it slowly modified into the current app as I wanted to learn about navigation through the app.

There have been alot of obstacles thus far. The biggest one being the "Saturn" functionality. It has been a challege trying to not only learn about computer vision, but also incorperate that into an endpoint. I believe that I will be able to figure it out as I keep working at it though.
